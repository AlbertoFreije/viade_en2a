== Introduction and Goals

This is the project viade_en2a and it will consist of a route managing application following the https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[SOLID specification] envisioned by https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i[Tim Berners Lee].

=== Requirements Overview

The main requirement of the project is that the system is based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the application.
Other high level requirements are the following:

* Users can store their routes in their own PODs.
* Users can view the stored routes on a map.
* Users can share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends.
* A user should get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.
* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route.
* Interoperability with other route management systems.

=== Quality Goals

The quality goals are the non-functional requirements, i.e the requirements that are not related to how the application functions but its properties as a whole.
Some of the most important quality attributes of this application are listed below.

|===
|Quality Goal|Scenario
| Interoperability | A final user should be able to use other SOLID based route applications and use their own POD the same way it is used for this application.
| Testability | The application is testable on all its development phases.
| Robustness | The whole application should be prepared against errors so that the probability of a user seeing one is highly reduced.
| Mobile Friendly | The whole application can be used and has a pleasant layout on smartphones and other mobile devices.
| Usability | Any user should have ease when using the application.
